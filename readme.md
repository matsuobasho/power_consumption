# Electricity consumption forecasting with LSTMs

### This is an adaptation of a tutorial on LSTM's on machinelearningmastery.com (https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-lstm-models-for-multi-step-time-series-forecasting-of-household-power-consumption/#comment-494688)
The repo is a way for me to confirm understanding applications of LSTM's and to get hands-on practice setting one up

### Setup
Download the source data from the tutorial link

### Running
Run train.py

### Notes
Initial run is multivariate input using all variables in dataset from previous week to predict next week's power consumption
